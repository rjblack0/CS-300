# CS-300

//What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?//
The problem for this course was to to build a program that could read data from a file, store it efficiently, and let users list out or look up specific courses by keywords. The main challenge was understanding and then determining which data structure worked best for sorting and searching.

//How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.//
I learned about arrays, hash tables, and binary search trees, then ultimately decided to chose the binary search tree because it keeps data sorted and makes lookups quick. Data structures matter because they determine how fast and clean your program runs.

//How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?//
Getting the file input to work correctly took some trial and error, especially with formatting and missing data. I fixed that by cleaning up input lines and doing a two-pass load so prerequisites always matched up.

//How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?//
It taught me to plan before coding. Writing the pseudocode first made the actual program much easier to build and debug. I realized that understanding the data flow saves a lot of time later.

//How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?//
I’ve started commenting my code more and keeping things organized so it’s easy to follow. I also try to name things clearly and write functions that could be reused or modified without breaking everything else.
